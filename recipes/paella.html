    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A classic Spanish rice dish from Valencia, traditionally cooked in a wide pan and infused with saffron.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <uL>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>10 large raw tiger prawns in their shells, heads removed and kept</li>
        <li>small bunch of parsley leaves and stalks separated, leaves roughly chopped</li>
        <li>100ml dry sherry or white wine</li>
        <li>500g mussels</li>
        <li>large pinch of saffron strands</li>
        <li>150g cooking chorizo cut into chunks</li>
        <li>1 onion (finely chopped)</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves (finely chopped)</li> 
        <li>1 medium squid (about 300g), cleaned and cut into rings with tentacles intact</li>
        <li>2 ripe tomatoes (roughly chopped)</li>
        <li>250g paella rice</li>
        <li>100g frozen podded broad beans or peas (or a mixture of the two), defrosted</li>
        <li>1 lemon (finely zested then cut into wedges)</li>
        <li>smoked sea salt(optional)</li>
    </uL>
    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a wide, shallow pan. Add the prawn heads and parsley stalks and sizzle until the heads turn pink, then mash with a potato masher. 
        Pour over the sherry or wine and 300ml water, season with salt and simmer for 10 mins to make a stock, mashing the prawn heads as they cook.</li>
        <li>Scatter the mussels into the pan, cover the pan loosely with a lid or tea towel, then put over a high heat for 3-4 mins until the mussels just open. 
        Stir to release the mussel juices, then pour the contents of the pan into a colander set over a large bowl containing the saffron. Let the saffron steep in the stock
        – you will need 700ml in total, so top up with water if needed and give everything a good stir. 
        Pick the mussels out from the colander, then set aside.</li>

        <li>Tuck the prawn tails into the rice and simmer for 5 mins, turning them over until cooked through. Stir through the mussels and broad beans or peas. 
        Taste the rice – if it is still a little raw but the pan is dry, add a splash more stock and continue to cook; if it’s too soupy, then increase the heat to cook off the last of the stock.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is just cooked, turn off the heat and cover with a tea towel for a few minutes. Scatter over the parsley leaves and lemon zest, then season with smoked salt if you like. 
        Stir everything once, then serve straight from the pan, with lemon wedges on the side.</li>
    </ol>
