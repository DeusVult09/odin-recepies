# Odin Recipes

This is my first HTML project created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The goal of the project is to build a simple recipe website using only HTML, without any CSS or JavaScript at this stage.

## What I Built

- A homepage that links to individual recipe pages
- Multiple recipe pages containing ingredients and steps
- Links, images, and basic HTML structure

## Skills Demonstrated

- Writing clean HTML semantic
- Define parts of HTML element
- Using relative and root-relative links
- Using attributes to show basic HTML behavior  
- Organizing files and folders for web development projects
- Embedding images and formatting lists
- Using anchor tags for internal and external navigation

## Reflection

This project helped me understand how to structure real-world HTML projects and gave me hands-on practice with basic but essential web development concepts. Iâ€™m gaining confidence in how web pages are connected and how content is organized on the file level.
